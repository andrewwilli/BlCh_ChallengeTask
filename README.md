# DinnerVote


This semester's challenge task (CT) is the design and implementation of an onchain voting application. Ideally, the application is a decentralized 
application (DApp).

* Find use-case or idea for your app
* Your app must include a simple frontend (e.g., HTML, Vue, React, Svelte, ...)
* Your app must include a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, ...)

## Requirements
All requirements below must be met in order to pass this lecture.

* A working prototype for your use-case
* Use latest stable releases of chosen libraries and frameworks
* Submission of a voting proposal, with previously known consequences and recipients (can be testnet)
* Onchain voting on proposal with at least 2 participants / identities (can be testnet)
* Successful vote needs to trigger something onchain. Can be an ERC20 or an NFT transfer (can be testnet)
* Voting status and process need to be shown in the frontend 

## Deliverables
01.11.2022, 23:59 (CET) first hand-in of your initial version of your challenge task (initial version, does not need to run). 
Second hand-in: 13.12.2022, 23:59 (CET) - well documented infrastructure (Readme.md or can be slides) and the source code (github/gitlab or similar) 
via invite or email to thomas.bocek-at-ost.ch. The code and configuration should be easy to read and/or well documented. For the presentation on 
the 14.12.2022, you should show the architecture, components, and design decisions in 10-15 min, a demo in 5-10 min, and the Q&A will be 5-10 min. 
After your presentation, you need to hand in your PDF presentation.

## Idea
This app can help people decide what to eat for dinner. To start a vote you need to pay a specific amount of Ethereum and submit at least one dinner idea. After that you can vote for multiple dinner ideas, but only once per idea.
